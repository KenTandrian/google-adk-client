# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new TypeScript client library for the Google ADK (Agent Development Kit). This library will provide a simple and robust way for developers to interact with Google ADK agent services from their applications.

## 2. Problem Statement

Developers who want to integrate with Google ADK agent services currently have to write their own API client logic. This is time-consuming, error-prone, and leads to duplicated code. Furthermore, integrating with popular AI frameworks like the Vercel AI SDK requires a deep understanding of both the ADK's streaming format and the AI SDK's specific data structures.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

- **Simplify Google ADK Integration:** Provide a high-level, easy-to-use client library that abstracts away the complexities of the Google ADK agent API.
- **Improve Developer Experience:** Offer a strongly-typed, well-documented library that enables developers to build integrations quickly and with confidence.
- **Promote Reusability:** Create a single, reusable library that can be used in any TypeScript project, including Next.js, Node.js, and browser-based applications.
- **Seamless AI SDK Integration:** Provide a simple and robust way to connect the Google ADK agent service to the Vercel AI SDK and its ecosystem of UI components.

## 4. Target Audience

- **Frontend Developers:** Developers building web applications that need to interact with a Google ADK agent service.
- **Backend Developers:** Developers building Node.js applications that need to interact with a Google ADK agent service.
- **AI Engineers:** Engineers who are building and deploying Google ADK agent services and want to provide an easy-to-use client for their users.

## 5. Features

### 5.1. `AdkClient`

The core of the library will be the `AdkClient` class. It will provide methods for all the Google ADK agent API endpoints, including:

- Session management
- Evaluation sets
- Artifacts
- Running agents (both streaming and non-streaming)

The `AdkClient` will be configurable to allow for different deployment environments and authentication schemes.

### 5.2. Vercel AI SDK Connectors

The library will provide two connectors for the Vercel AI SDK:

- **Server-Side Connector:** A function that transforms the Google ADK's SSE stream into the format expected by the `ai` package's `useChat` hook. This is designed for use in Next.js API routes and Server Actions.
- **Client-Side Connector (`ChatTransport`):** A class that implements the `ChatTransport` interface from the `ai/react` package. This allows the `useChat` hook to communicate directly with the Google ADK agent from the client-side.

## 6. Technical Requirements

- The library must be written in TypeScript.
- The library must be published to npm.
- The library must have a comprehensive test suite.
- The library must be well-documented.

## 7. Out of Scope

- This library will not provide any UI components. It is designed to be used with existing UI libraries like `@assistant-ui/react`.
- This library will not provide any server-side infrastructure for deploying Google ADK agents.

## 8. Success Metrics

- **Adoption:** The number of projects that use the Google ADK client library.
- **Developer Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from developers who use the library.
- **Reduction in Support Requests:** A decrease in the number of questions and issues related to Google ADK integration.
